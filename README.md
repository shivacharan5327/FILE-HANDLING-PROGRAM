I used Chatgpt as well as Youtube for understanding the concept, I used the  AI tool like Chatgpt  for some of the file operations,I done this whole program visual studio code editor.
This program is applicable at Data Logging Systems,Configuration File Management,Report Generation,Logging and Debugging,File-Based Database,Backup and Restore Functions,User input Storage.This C program illustrates the basic file handling methods such as creating, writing to, reading from, and appending to files. File handling is important in C programming . The createFile function also returns a file pointer; if created successfully, this file pointer will be used to write data into the file. The second function, writeToFile, writes a string and a newline to the file. The third function reads from the file and writes to the console. These three functions will effectively preview file handling (specifically the process of creating and modifying a file) and display the data from that file. The default filename in the program is testFile0.txt, but the filename to be used can be passed to all of the functions as an argument when calling. To run the program, you must define a filename that does not exist at the outset.In the main function, you have the choice to create a file; to write to a file to append data; or read from the file created with the createFile function. If data written to the file has not been read prior to calling the createFile function again, it is overwritten. You also have the chance to append data into the file with the writeToFile function. You would run the program several times, and call the functions createFile, writeToFile, readFromFile, and appendToFile in different combinations while staying consistent in the sequence they are called. File handling in C is easier when you know the expected behavior of the program by the sequence of functions called. The program contains a function called createFile, which takes a filename as input and attempts to create a file with that name using the fopen function in "w" mode. The "w" mode is used to create an empty file for writing; if the file already exists, its contents are erased. Inside this function, after attempting to open the file, the code checks if the file pointer returned by fopen is NULL. A NULL pointer indicates that the file could not be opened or created, possibly due to invalid file paths or lack of write permissions. If the file is created successfully, a confirmation message is printed, and the file is closed using the fclose function to free system resources. The program also includes another function named writeToFile, which again opens the file in "w" mode and writes content to it using the fprintf function. This function behaves similarly to printf but directs output to the file rather than the console. Like before, it checks for a NULL file pointer to prevent operations on an unopened file, which would lead to undefined behavior. Although not shown in the visible code, such a program can be extended with additional functions such as readFromFile, which would use "r" mode and functions like fscanf, fgets, or fgetc to read file contents, and appendToFile, which would use "a" mode to add content to the end of an existing file without modifying the original data. The key concepts demonstrated in this program include the use of file pointers (FILE *), different modes in fopen such as "r" for reading, "w" for writing, and "a" for appending, proper error checking to handle file open failures, and correct resource management by closing the file after operations are completed. These practices ensure that the program remains stable and efficient. Overall, this program provides a solid introduction to file handling in C, highlighting the importance of file access modes, error checking, and file closure. It serves as a foundational example for beginners to understand how to perform persistent data operations in C program
